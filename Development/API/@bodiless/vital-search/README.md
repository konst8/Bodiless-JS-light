# BodilessJS ligh

Simplified version of [Bodiless-JS](https://github.com/johnsonandjohnson/Bodiless-JS/): basically, just [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) with edit interface.

Currently in development.

Roadmap:
1. Remove:
- tailwind
- docs
- anything hosting related (e.g. p.sh)
- example sites, keep just one
- unnecessary scripts and utilities

2. Upgrade (if needed):
- general packages (gatsby, express etc.)

3. Refactor:
- backend
- types (may be)

4. Reduce functionality
- review and refactor everything related to look and feel
- review flow container
- may be remove i18n, search
- may be also slate editor, menu system
